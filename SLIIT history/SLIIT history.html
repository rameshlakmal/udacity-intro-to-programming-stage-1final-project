      <h1>SLIIT History</h1><br><br>
        <p>Founding
          Lalith Athulathmudali originally acquired the 25 acre
          land where SLIIT stands today in the 1980s in the
          expectation of building a Technological University and the headquarters of the Mahapola Trust Fund.[citation needed] Minister of
          Commerce Kingsley Wickramaratne and Richard Pathirana would eventually use the land for establishing SLIIT.[9]
          The Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology was
          established in 1999 by incorporation under the Companies Act of 2007 as a
          nonprofit company by guarantee (registration number GL 24) with the ability to award Bachelor
          of Science degrees following amendments to the Universities Act the same year, thus gaining
          recognition from the Minister of Higher Education.[10][11][12] SLIIT was established primarily
          to educate and train information technology professionals.</p>
