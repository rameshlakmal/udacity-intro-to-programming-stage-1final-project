        <h1>STUDENT FEEDBACK</h1><br><br>
      SLIIT was a brand new life for me, and the subjects were really interesting and challenging. Initially I was worried because the majority of the students were from the Mathematics stream but it did not take so long to realize that it does not matter. My passion towards the technology and the enthusiasm to regularly practice what I learned, led me to very good results in the exams. Programming algorithms, networking, deep studies on computers, lab sessions were irresistible. I completed the first year of my degree with a GPA of 3.8 impressing both parents and myself. Since my ambition was to become a Software Engineer, I spent more time to learn programming and even completed Sun Certified Java Programmer certification over the vacation. During the second year, we were informed by SLIIT about a scholarship program conducted by Virtusa, one of the leading software companies in Sri Lanka. Students having a GPA above 3.5 were eligible to apply but only 19 were selected, and I was lucky to be included.

      I schooled at St. Joseph’s College, and as a fresh school leaver after A/Ls my primary objective was to be a professional in the ICT industry. When choosing an institute to do my Bachelor’s degree, I was attracted to SLIIT mainly because of the flexibility it provided for students to do their studies part time which allowed me to start off my professional career in parallel to my studies. The degree program was well-rounded as it was able to equip me with the necessary knowledge as well as soft skills required to be a successful individual in the industry. The lecturers were very supportive and professionals in their respective field and always shared their insights and experiences in class which helped us understand the practical aspects in addition to the theory. As an undergraduate there were many extra-curricular activities where I had the opportunity to get involved where I made new friends and also good memories. Currently I’m employed at Zone24x7 which is a leading provider of global technology innovation services.

      I’m Yashodha De Silva and I’m done my A/L in Presbyterian Girls’ National School. I GRADUATED FROM SLIIT with a first class honor for the degree program B.Sc. Information Technology in 2013. After completing my A/L’s I wanted to do the IT degree. One of my friend recommended me this program. So I have stared the degree on 2010 and those 3 years are the most wonderful time in my life. My campus experience was a fantastic one. I made some amazing friends. And also the various academy events like Open day helped myself to create new ideas and meet industry experts. I must say the academic staff is really supportive and making it a much easier place to learn. After completing successfully my degree I received the Merit award given for the meritorious performance in 2015. My experience at SLIIT was pivotal to my career success. Going to SLIIT helped me understand and respect multiple cultures which is essential part of working in a diverse company such as Virtusa Polaris.I would like to recommended SLIIT.
