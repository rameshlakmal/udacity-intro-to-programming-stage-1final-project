        SLIIT has two main campuses in the Western Province- a Metropolitan campus in central Colombo, and a flagship suburban campus at Malabe. The Malabe campus covers an area of about 10 ha (25 acres), making it the larger of the two campuses, and houses the faculties of Computing, Business and Engineering, as well as the main library. Located between Kaduwela and Malabe along the New Kandy Road, it is the only SLIIT campus with sporting facilities. The smaller Metropolitan campus is located within the Bank of Ceylon Merchant Tower at Kollupitiya, hosting mostly postgraduate facilities.
        The institute also has regional centres in Kandy, Matara<br><h2>FOR MORE INFORMATIONS CHEAKOUT THE LINKS DOWN BELOW.</h2>
